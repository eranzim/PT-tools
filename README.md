# PT-tools
Various tools for Penetration Testing

## Combinator
Useful for generating passwords for a dictionary attack based on a target's name (for example).

## Subdomainer
Finds subdomains of a given website. Works well with https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/axfr/blob/master/subdomains_nc.txt (entire runtime is likely to take a while, but it will find most results quickly, and the script allows for stopping and picking up from a previous spot)

## SubdomainDataExtractor
Collects data about a given list of subdomains. Useful to run on the output of Subdomainer.
